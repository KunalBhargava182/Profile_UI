# Profile UI Android App

A clean and elegant **Android Profile UI** built using **XML layouts** and the **View system**. This project showcases how to design a modern profile screen with custom fonts, drawable resources, and Material Design theming â€” making it a great reference for beginners and UI enthusiasts.



# *Built With* :

1. Development Environment: *Android Studio*
2. Programming Language: *Kotlin*
3. UI: *Android View System (XML Layouts)*
# *Key Features* :

- Profile screen layout using XML.
- Custom font integration (**Poppins** family)
- ConstraintLayout-based responsive UI
- Includes user profile picture, name, profession, and styled buttons
- Clean and structured resource usage for drawables, strings, and themes
- Icons used from **Google Fonts**




# *Note* :

(This UI is heavily inspired by the CRED application's Profile UI, which is known for its clean, modern design, and use of custom fonts and icons. While aiming for a similar aesthetic, I have created this UI using freely available icons and fonts.  The font family used in this implementation is Poppins.)
